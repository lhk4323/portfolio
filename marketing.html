          <div>Digital Marketing has evolved significantly in the past decade. 10 years ago, display banners, SEM, and email were the most common forms of internet advertising. Now you have a variety of digital advertising platforms to choose from. I want to briefly go over the more common digital marketing mediums that I've had experience in dealing with in my years working in digital marketing. There are certainly more mediums than this that I haven't covered (such as working with affiliates and affiliate networks) and I wll update this piece over time as I get the research together.</div>

          <div id="display"><h2>Display Advertising</h2><p>Display is still one of the most common forms of advertising. To the consumer, it's the same as it has been for decades. To the marketer, the KPIs (key performance indicators) of display advertising has moved beyond impressions, clicks, and conversions. Viewability, engagement rates, bounce rates, and many more metrics are reviewed to determine overall campaign performance as a whole.</p>
          <p>Display, while being one of the more simpler advertising mediums, has a host of challenges to have it succeed. The average CTR hovers around .35%, which while not bad (and better than it used to be), pales in comparison to search (the other common digital advertising medium). Even though search is more expensive, the overall CPA tends to back out better according to Google Benchmarks (as discussed on this <a style="color: blue" href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/adwords-bechmark-data" target="_blank">article from hubspot.com</a>) </p><p>A common way advertisers have made their display channel more effective is through the use of Data Management Platforms (DMP) to run alongside display ads. DMPs are, as suggested by the acronym, data points that can be used to pinpoint who you want to see the ad. Let's say you want to target a mom in Los Angeles that has a household income of around 70k or more. A DMP can help you do that because they have the data available to target that specific user.  Ever talk about something or search for something on your phone or work computer, only to find that you're being bombarded with ads on your Instagram feed about the exact same product?  Thank the DMPs for piecing that data together. <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/digital-marketing-101-series-dmp-dictionary/" target="_blank" style="color: blue">Adobe</a> has a nice blog post that presents a more technical discussion about DMPs.</p><p>Display can get very deep with targeting options because the inventory itself can be found fairly cheap. A common tactic (Amazon does this a lot) is retargeting. If you look at something on Amazon, and then go to another site, you might see a 300x250 box ad with the very item you were JUST looking at on Amazon. Creepy, but retargeting been <a style="color: blue" href="https://blog.spiralytics.com/retargeting-statistics" target="_blank">proven</a> to be an effective tool to use with your display channel. </p></div> <a style="color: blue" href="#navbar">Back to top</a>
          <div id="email"><h2>Email</h2><p>Email has come a long way. In the past, spam was wildly out of control, but with government regulation and evolving spam filtering technologies, the issue isn't as prevalent as before. Not only that, marketers have discovered that users that opt-in to emails are engaged, which is good to know that you have an audience</p>
          <p>Emails can generally be categorized into 3 types: Triggered, autoresponder, and newsletter emails. Newsletter emails are your basic "Hey XYZ here's what's going on this month" that you get probably every week. Autoresponder emails are typically emails sent in response to something that a user did, such as sign up for a service or make a purchase. Triggered emails are unique in that a user receives an individual email based on that user's action (or inaction). Maybe you went to Amazon to buy something, but decided against it? Don't be surprised if Amazon sends an email asking you if you're still interested in the item you looked at.  Triggered emails and aut-responder emails perform much better than newsletter emails according to <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.smartinsights.com/email-marketing/email-communications-strategy/statistics-sources-for-email-marketing/" target="_blank">these insights.</a>. A very thorough analytical report of email marketing benchmarks can be found on  <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.getresponse.com/resources/reports/email-marketing-benchmarks.html" target="_blank">getresponse.com</a>.  </p>
          <p>To summarize, it's best to use a combination of all three types of emails, but when doing automated emails, include opportunities to upsell. Did someone buy a shaker bottle online? Have the purchase confirmation include ads for a complementary product, like protein powder. Maybe give them a coupon too. For triggered emails, the obvious is to lure a customer that was looking at an item, but also offer complementary items or alternatives?

          <div id="sem"><h2>SEM</h2><p>Most people know SEM as SEO/SEM. In reality, SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.reliablesoft.net/what-is-the-difference-between-seo-and-sem/" target="_blank">one of the functions</a> under SEM, which also includes paid search. Think of those "promoted" results when you search for something in Google. That's paid search.  SEM is incredible powerful because organic search results in higher quality visits to your site. Someone found your site because they were genuinely curious about what you talk about on your site. By having Google index your site to be of "high quality" according to their metrics (which they don't specifically release), the chances are your site will show up on the first page and thus, receive more visitors. </p>

<p>Your basic foray into SEM is making sure your meta tags describe your site's content in a human way. Think of it as an elevator pitch. If you were to give an elevator pitch to someone about your website, what would you say? That's what you would need to promote in your meta tags.  Other ways to improve your search engine results is to ensure all of your tags are marked up, your content is updated, and, if possible, have original video content.</p>

</div><a style="color: blue" href="#navbar">Back to top</a>
          <div id="mobile"><h2>Mobile</h2><p>Mobile marketing itself is actually broader than it sounds. Mobile generally refers to online activity anything NOT on a desktop. Galaxy tablets, iPads, iPhones, etc. Those are all mobile (although most companies will specify between tablets and phones). To make things more complicated, tablets and phones can be broken down even further to app traffic or mobile web traffic. Mobile app traffic is different from mobile web traffic, even if it's all on the same device.  According to <a style="color: blue" href="https://medium.com/@drync/mobile-web-vs-mobile-app-6df0fbd48503" target="_blank">this article published on medium.com</a>, between mobile web and mobile app, app is far more important for a brand due to longer engagement times and apps account for more ecommerce sales than mobile web. </p>

<p><a style="color: blue" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/" target="_blank">According to stiatisa.com, </a> mobile traffic accounts for nearly half of all web traffic worldwide and it's expected to overtake desktop. For this reason, marketing specifically towards mobile platforms should not be ignored. </p>

<p>Within mobile apps, you typically see ads that have some sort of incentive to download and install another app. The advertiser pays the app that led to the download a negotiated amount once an install is done (typically called CPI, or cost per install. Note this is slightly different than the other well known CPI, cost per incentive). The benefit of mobile apps is that you have a better idea of your audience and you'll certainly drive the leads, the downside is that the "quality" and value of the customer installing the app may not be good if the user just wanted the "freebie" from installing the app. However, if the numbers make sense and the law of averages works in your favor, CPI with proper targeting might be a great solution to increase your bottom line.</p></div><a style="color: blue" href="#navbar">Back to top</a>
          <div id="socialMedia"><h2>Social Media</h2><p>Social media is an interesting beast. On one hand, it's the next best thing to word of mouth advertising. On the other hand, users are slowly becoming more aware of what's an ad and what isn't. The stories about influencers being paid to promote a product are more than true. With that said, if you can find the right influencers for your brand, then it's a partnership that should do well. </p>

<p>In my experience with social media marketing as a middleman, the most difficult work is dealing with the influencers. Some have horrible response times. I've dealt with influencers that deliver extremely poor quality videos and posts that would ended up damaging a brand had it been set live. On the other hand, we've had some that did a fantastic job representing the brand. As a brand, you need to realize that using influencers is essentially hiring freelancers that do their own productions with their own equipment and editing, so you don't really know what you're getting. It's times like these that you might be better off using a company that specializes in working with influencers to let them handle the logistics of it all (like I used to do with engage:BDR). </p></div><a style="color: blue" href="#navbar">Back to top</a>
          <div id="video"><h2>Video</h2><p>Video as a medium is expensive and, in my experience using it as a pure lead generation medium, it's not effective due to high costs. Whereas a display ad could run you for $1-2 CPM, video could easily be $8 or $9 CPM. Engagement tends to be high, but right now, video is riddled with fraudulent activity. Going direct to a publisher to buy their video traffic can get very expensive ($20+ CPMs are not unheard of) and the alternative is to go through exchanges and networks, which can be much cheaper. However, you have less visibility to where they are actually running your campaigns. Let's say you contact ad network XYZ because they claim they can run your video ads on msn.com, espn.com, and other large well known publishers at a far cheaper rate. When they buy the traffic, they will most likely source it from an exchange or another network, which told them they could get that traffic. And thus begins an endless spiral of referrals from one network to another until the requested domain is detected. By then, there's a high possibility someone has spoofed the domain or there's so many ad calls that there's a high chance of timing out, thus resulting in your ad not even being shown and your ad spend not moving. </p>

<p>Another, more recent, <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/in-banner-video-ad-fraud" target="_blank">
                  uncovering of ad fraud</a> is hiding video ads behind legitimate banner ads (on both mobile and desktop environments). With this fraud, an ad server will say they delivered an ad because it played. However, realistically, no human eye<a style="color: blue" href="https://videoadnews.com/2018/03/22/mcdonalds-the-latest-to-fall-victim-of-ad-fraud/" target="_blank">could see it.</a></p>

<p>This has led to a metric called viewability to be important with the video environment. If you decide run video ads for your brand, make sure you work with publishers and networks that guarantee at least a 75% viewability score (which is realistic, the average <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/viewability/#/state-of-viewability" target="_blank">according to Google </a> is about 66% for video and 49% for display). </p></div><a style="color: blue" href="#navbar">Back to top</a>
          <div id="viewability"><h3>The Viewability Metric</h3><p>I want to discuss about viewability a little more. It gets brought up more often than not in video, but consider display. For years, even before Facebook, it was common to see display ads that aren't in front of your face. Say, towards the end of an article, you'll see an ad towards the bottom (commonly called BTF, or below-the-fold). For the most part, those ads never have strong performane and viewability (the ad may load but no one ever actually sees it). Some publishers designed their website to where BTF ads can perform (although those are few and far between). When you buy display traffic, ask specifically for ATF (above-the-fold) inventory. BTF inventory should almost never be purchased. If they include it for free, sure why not. I have had success with some publishers with BTF inventory due to cost. BTF inventory should be less than half the price of an ATF unit, ideally sub $.75 CPM for BTF display inventory (and honestly, probably that same amount for video, even though it's not a realistic number but IMO that's what it's worth). </p>
</div><a style="color: blue" href="#navbar">Back to top</a>
          <div id="native"><h2>Native</h2><img id="myImg" style="float: right" height="200em" src="img/msn%20native%20ads.png" alt="msn.com Native ads sample">
              <span id="myModal" class="modal">
                  <span class="close">&times;</span>
                  <img class="modal-content" id="img01">
                  <div id="caption"></div>
              </span><p>
              

Now stemming off viewability and BTF is native ads. 
This is the one exception to the BTF rule because native ads are designed to look like they're part of an article.  Typically you can buy these placements on a CPC, although buying on a CPM or sponsorships is something that is also done (and the last time I looked into it, becoming more common). One of the more common examples you can see from the image on the right, but this <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/07/07/native-advertising-examples" target="_blank">wordstream article</a>, although 5 years old, gives great examples of other native ads.  </p>

              

<p>Native ads's effectiveness lies within the content itself. No matter if you buy a full page piece of sponsored content or a sponsored link, make sure the content lines up with your brand, is well-written, fresh, and interesting. Recycling old content you used elsewhere will most likely not perform as well. Letting the publisher write the content is also asking for trouble because you don't know if they're going to represent your brand as well as you are (although they always vet the article with the advertiser first before posting).</p></div><a style="color: blue" href="#navbar">Back to top</a>
          
          <div id="final"><h2>Final Points</h2><p>One final suggestion about digital marketing: don't wait until the last minute. You're asking for a lot of trouble if you don't get the requested digital assets to your publisher with ideally at least three business days notice. I've seen this far too many times and I've seen the following happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>1) Advertiser forgets to send an impression pixel, campaign doesn't launch (or, even worse, launches with no way to track on the advertiser's end), and the entire campaign, budgeting, and deliverables get messed up</li>
    <br>
<li>2) Advertiser sends the WRONG impression pixel, there's no time to test, everything gets messed up.</li>
    <br>
<li>3) Sort of related to #2, the publisher's adops team has no time to QA appropriately and the launch goes horribly wrong. </li>
    <br>
<li>4) The publisher's adops team will not prioritize you (unless you're their top client). Because on their end, they have sales people all over the place yelling that their campaign is a prioirity. When everything suddenly becomes a priority, nothing becomes a priority. </li></ol>

<p>And you really don't have much recourse without damaging the relationship. Now if you had sent assets over in a timely manner, had all the QA done, and the publisher messes up the launch, you have recourse and, assuming they're willing to swallow their pride, will do some sort of make-good. </p>

<p>One of my team members once launched a direct response performance-based campaign with a publisher with a test budget of $15k to be spread over a few weeks so we can optimize on our end during the flight. IO was written, signed, terms were agreed to, and the publisher had the assets well ahead of time. On the first day of the launch, someone on their team did not set the flight dates correctly and spent the entire $15k budget in one day. I contacted them, politely pointed out the error, pointed out their T&amp;Cs where they guaranteed a "reasonable flight", and received $15k in credit so we could run the campaign appropriately.</p>
              
              <p>Before finishing up, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention ad fraud issues again. I know I mentioned it in the <a href="#video" style="color: blue">video</a> section earlier, but ad fraud is something to consider as a problem when reviewing your performance reports. There are ad fraud detection vendors available to consider: <a href="https://mediatrust.com/" target="_blank" styte="color: blue">The Media Trust</a>, <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.whiteops.com/" target="_blank">White Ops</a>, <a href style="color: blue" href="https://integralads.com/" target="_blank">Integral Ad Science (IAS)</a>, <a style="color: blue" href="https://impact.com/ad-fraud-detection/" target="_blank">Forensiq </a>, <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.pixalate.com/" target="_blank">Pixalate</a>, and <a style="color: blue" href="https://www.doubleverify.com/" target="_blank">DoubleVerify</a>. I'm sure there's more, but these are the ones I've had experiencing in dealing with. They all have their own detection algorithms, but finding one that fits your needs, both functionally and budget-wise, is important when delving deep into digital advertising.</p>
