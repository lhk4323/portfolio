Portfolio page
This is all of the code I used for my portfolio page, lklbc.com.  Some jQuery is used on the index page to have the images on the index page change opacity when hovered over.  jQuery is also used throughout the entire site to load the navigation bar, which is actually a separate HTML file. I found it's far more efficient to have a script call the navigation vs having it on every page coded in HTML so I don't need to repeat myself on multiple changes if I decided to add (or remove) something.

This was originally a class project that I morphed into what you see now.
